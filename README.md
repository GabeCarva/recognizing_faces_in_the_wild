# Recognizing Families In the Wild (RFIW): Entry by Gabriel Carvalho-Silva

This is an entry for Recognizing Families in the Wild, details and data can be found here. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/recognizing-faces-in-the-wild/data

Additional details on the data found in the README file in the input folder

The main code is located in ./input/recognizing_faces.ipynb
The code was run in Google Colab and so has some optional blocks to enable this run. Images were preprocessed in the code to speed the upload to Colab for the upload, but need not be to run locally - the code will check for preprocessed images and use them if available. 

To run the code unzip test and train from the dataset and copy them into input.
